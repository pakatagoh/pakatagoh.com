        <p>
          Born in 1990 and raised in sunny Singapore. If you&apos;re wondering
          why my name sounds strange, it&apos;s because it&apos;s a Buddhist
          name. I&apos;m Singaporean Chinese. I attended the National University
          of Singapore (NUS) and graduated with a degree in mechanical
          engineering in 2015. During university, I was part of the NUS Formula
          Student team competing in the Formula Student (FSAE) Michigan
          competiton.
        </p>
        <p>
          In July 2018, I decided to leave my job as a technical sales engineer
          in the industrial sector to pursue software development as a career.
          After about 6 months of self-learning, I managed to secure an
          internship at a local startup. In Feb 2019, I joined a bootcamp
          conducted by ThoughtWorks (Singapore).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, Iâ€™ve worked in a few startups before my latest position at
          foodpanda.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I dabble in a little photography and keep up with
          Formula 1 during race weekends.
