As a front end developer, you will inevitably run into animations and transitions. If you're in the React ecosystem and your application has many complex animations, [react-spring](https://react-spring.dev) is a great library that helps to build your animations. In this post we will see how to get started with some simple examples.

## Overview

The engine behind react-spring works based on physics and it tries to animate your elements based on how they would if they were in the real world. If you have taken physic classes in school that covers topics like simple harmonic motion or hook's law, you may have a greater appreciation for why react-spring is so brilliant. I know I do.

In essence, animations in react-spring don't run based off time, they run based off physical properties that are configured into animations and the duration of the animation is just a result of these physical properties. If you'd like to use time based animations, react-spring has an escape hatch for you to do so.

## Setup

Ensure you have node and npm or yarn installed. Next, you should have a React application setup. You can do setup a React application easily by using [create react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

`npx create-react-app react-spring-tutorial`

Once the process is complete, you should see a new folder called `react-spring-tutorial` created in your directory.

Navigate into that directory and install react-spring

`cd react-spring-tutorial`

`npm install react-spring`

Run the following command

`npm start`

and you should see your React application open in the browser

## The react-spring APIs

These are the 5 hooks from react-spring that we'll cover:

> - `useSpring` a single spring, moves data from a -> b
> - `useSprings` multiple springs, for lists, where each spring moves data from a -> b
> - `useTrail` multiple springs with a single dataset, one spring follows or trails behind the other
> - `useTransition` for mount/unmount transitions (lists where items are added/removed/updated)
> - `useChain` to queue or chain multiple animations together

### useSpring

The `useSpring` API serves as the basis for learning how to use the other 4 APIs.

We will build the following animated component below

<NoScript message="Please enable javascript to experience the demo"/>
<Translate client:only="react" />

Create a file in the `src` folder called `Translate.js` and insert the following code

```javascript
//Translate.js
import React from "react";
import { useSpring, animated } from "@react-spring/web";

const Translate = () => {
  const spring = useSpring({
    from: {
      transform: `translate(0px)`,
    },
    to: {
      transform: `translate(120px)`,
    },
    config: {
      mass: 6,
    },
  });

  return (
    <animated.div style={{ ...spring, display: "inline-block" }}>
      Translated Div
    </animated.div>
  );
};

export default Translate;
```

Replace the contents of `App.js` with the code below

```javascript
// App.js
import React from "react";
import Translate from "./Translate";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Translate />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

If you have your server running, you should see the `Translated Div` text being translated across the screen on page load. If so, you've created your first animated component! ðŸ¥³

Let's breakdown the code that was just written in `Translate.js`

```javascript
const spring = useSpring({
  from: {
    transform: `translate(0px)`,
  },
  to: {
    transform: `translate(120px)`,
  },
  config: {
    mass: 6,
  },
});
```

`useSpring` accepts an object with a `from` and `to` property. There's an optional `config` property which allows you to fine tune the animation settings.

`from` indicates the values of properties from which the animation starts. In our case, we are saying the value of the `transform` property shall start from `translate(0px)`.

`to` indicates the values that properties should animate towards. In the example, we are animating towards `translate(120px)`

It's good to note that react-spring does recognize css property values such as the `translate` value we are using here. Other examples include animating colors, `color: 'red'` to `color: 'blue'`, or with rgb `color: rgb(0,0,0)` to `color: rgb(255,255,255)`

And we do not necessarily need to animate css properties. react-spring animates values. So we could define our own keys and react-spring will animate the values accordingly. We just need to use the `to` helper method. For example

```javascript
const Translate = () => {
  const spring = useSpring({
    from: {
      myXTranslateValue: 0,
    },
    to: {
      myXTranslateValue: 120,
    },
    config: {
      mass: 6,
    },
  });

  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        transform: spring.myXTranslateValue.to(
          (myXTranslateValue) => `translate(${myXTranslateValue}px)`,
        ),
        display: "inline-block",
      }}
    >
      Translated Div
    </animated.div>
  );
};
```

The `config` in our example changes the `mass` property to 6. The default value for the `mass` property is 1. Increasing the mass will increase the inertia of the spring/animation. Just imagine what would happen if you have a large weight on a spring compared to a lighter weight. The heavier one will bob about longer.

For more info on what properties you can configure under `config`, take a look at https://react-spring.dev/docs/components/use-spring#reference

The value returned from `useSpring` contains your animated values. In order to make sense of these animated values, you need to pass it to an `animated` component provided by react-spring.

### useSprings

The `useSprings` API allows you to create a list of springs with different configurations

To demonstrate useSprings, let's create a horizontal bar graph shown below. Click the Animate button to see how the bar graph will animate on page load.

Note: The animation below is not staggered. The appear to be staggered because each bar has a different mass and expand at different rates. Hence it looks like they are staggered. We will do staggederd animations in the useTrail section.

<NoScript message="Please enable javascript to experience the demo"/>
<BarGraph client:only="react" />

In `App.js`, comment out `<Translate/>` and import and use `<BarGraph/>`

```javascript
// App.js
import React from "react";
import Translate from "./Translate";
import BarGraph from "./BarGraph";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* <Translate /> */}
      <BarGraph />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Create a new file in the `src` folder called `BarGraph.js` and insert the following code

```javascript
// BarGraph.js
import React from "react";
import { useSprings, animated } from "@react-spring/web";

const bars = [
  {
    key: "bar1",
    color: "green",
    from: {
      width: "0px",
    },
    to: {
      width: "100px",
    },
    config: {
      mass: 20,
    },
  },
  {
    key: "bar2",
    color: "blue",
    from: {
      width: "0px",
    },
    to: {
      width: "250px",
    },
    config: {
      mass: 30,
    },
  },
  {
    key: "bar3",
    color: "red",
    from: {
      width: "0px",
    },
    to: {
      width: "150px",
    },
    config: {
      mass: 13,
    },
  },
];

const BarGraph = () => {
  const springs = useSprings(
    bars.length,
    bars.map(({ color, key, ...config }) => config),
  );

  return springs.map((spring, index) => (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        ...spring,
        height: "20px",
        marginBottom: "10px",
        backgroundColor: bars[index].color,
      }}
    />
  ));
};

export default BarGraph;
```

Let's go through what we have in `BarGraph.js`

```javascript
const springs = useSprings(
  number,
  [config, config, config....]
);
```

`useSprings` accepts 2 arguments. The first will be a number which indicates the number springs to generate and the 2nd argument is an array of spring configurations. You will be returned with an array of animated values which you can iterate over

Our spring configurations are listed in `bars`.

```javascript
// Our list of spring configurations
const bars = [
  {
    key: 'bar1', // we need a key as we are generating and array of components
    color: 'green', // this is to give a static color to each bar
    from: {
      width: '0px',
    },
    to: {
      width: '100px',
    },
    config: {
      mass: 20,
    },
  },
  ...
]
```

and we insert `bars` into `useSprings` accordingly

```javascript
const springs = useSprings(
  bars.length,
  bars.map(({ color, key, ...config }) => config), // we are omitting color and key prop as we are not animating them
);
```

We then iterate over `springs` to generate a list of horizontal bars, each with a specific animation defined in `bars`

```javascript
return springs.map((spring, index) => (
  <animated.div
    key={bars[index].key}
    style={{
      ...spring,
      height: "20px",
      marginBottom: "10px",
      backgroundColor: bars[index].color,
    }}
  />
));
```

### useTrail

We will build a trailing animation with a set of vertical bars. Each vertical bar will animate after the previous one with the help of `useTrail`. Click on the animate button below to see how it'll look like on page load.

<NoScript message="Please enable javascript to experience the demo"/>
<StaggeredBars client:only="react" />

In `App.js` comment out `<BarGraph/>` and insert `<StaggeredBars/>`

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Translate from "./Translate";
import BarGraph from "./BarGraph";
import StaggeredBars from "./StaggeredBars"; //import StaggeredBars

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* <Translate /> */}
      {/* <BarGraph /> */}
      <StaggeredBars /> // Use StaggeredBars
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Create a new file called `StaggeredBars.js` and insert the following code

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useTrail, animated } from "@react-spring/web";

const colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "orange", "purple", "yellow"];

const StaggeredBars = () => {
  const trailSprings = useTrail(colors.length, {
    from: { height: "0px" },
    to: { height: "80px" },
  });

  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "flex-end", height: "500px" }}>
      {trailSprings.map((spring, index) => (
        <animated.div
          key={colors[index]}
          style={{
            ...spring,
            width: "20px",
            marginRight: "10px",
            transformOrigin: "bottom",
            backgroundColor: colors[index],
          }}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default StaggeredBars;
```

Just like the `useSprings` api, it accepts 2 arguments. However, the 2nd argument this time only accepts a single spring configuration.

### useTransition

The useTransition api is useful when you want to animate components that are mounting/unmounting from the page.
Click on the button below to see how the component will animate when we are mounting/unmounting it.

<NoScript message="Please enable javascript to experience the demo"/>
<DisappearingComponent client:only="react" />

In `App.js` comment out `<StaggeredBars/>` and insert `<DisappearingComponent/>`

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Translate from "./Translate";
import BarGraph from "./BarGraph";
import StaggeredBars from "./StaggeredBars";
import DisappearingComponent from "./DisappearingComponent";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* <Translate /> */}
      {/* <BarGraph /> */}
      {/* <StaggeredBars /> */}
      <DisappearingComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Create a new file called `DisappearingComponent.js` and insert the following code

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useTransition, animated } from "@react-spring/web";

const DisappearingComponent = () => {
  const [isDisplay, setIsDisplay] = useState(true);
  const transitions = useTransition(isDisplay, {
    from: { transform: `translateX(50px)`, opacity: 0 },
    enter: { transform: `translateX(0px)`, opacity: 1 },
    leave: { transform: `translateX(50px)`, opacity: 0 },
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div style={{ width: "50px", height: "20px" }}>
        {transitions(
          (style, item) =>
            item && (
              <animated.div style={{ ...style, display: "inline-block" }}>
                Yo
              </animated.div>
            ),
        )}
      </div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setIsDisplay((prevState) => !prevState);
        }}
      >
        click
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

export default DisappearingComponent;
```

Let's checkout what's going here.

```javascript
const [isDisplay, setIsDisplay] = useState(true);
const transitions = useTransition(isDisplay, {
  from: { transform: `translateX(50px)`, opacity: 0 },
  enter: { transform: `translateX(0px)`, opacity: 1 },
  leave: { transform: `translateX(50px)`, opacity: 0 },
});
```

`useTransition` accepts 2 arguments. The 1st argument is a changing state and in this case, the state is a boolean value. The 2nd argument is an object describing the transition lifecycles

In our example, we are using the 3 basic life cycles `from`, `enter`, `leave` which would probably cover most use cases.

`from` describes the properties from which the animation starts. `enter` describes the properties that the animation transitions towards when component is mounted. `leave` describes the properties that the animation transitions towards before the component unmounts.

For more info on other properties that can be configured, head to https://react-spring.dev/docs/components/use-transition

```javascript
{
  transitions(
    (style, item) =>
      item && (
        <animated.div style={{ ...style, display: "inline-block" }}>
          Yo
        </animated.div>
      ),
  );
}
```

`useTransition` returns `transition function`

This `transition function` takes in a render function that returns a component. The render function is called with 2 arguments. The first is the `style` argument which contains the current styling state of the animation. The 2nd argument refers to the data you passed in as the 1st argument to `useTransition`

When we click animate, we are toggling the `isDisplay` state and we can see the animation occur as we are conditionally rendering the `animated.div`

### useChain

`useChain` allows us to set the order of declared spring animations. In our example, we will chain a `useSpring` together with a `useTrail` animation. Click animate below to see the example in action.

<NoScript message="Please enable javascript to experience the demo"/>
<TranslateStaggeredBars client:only="react" />

In `App.js` comment out `<DisappearingComponent/>` and insert `<TranslateStaggeredBars/>`

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Translate from "./Translate";
import BarGraph from "./BarGraph";
import StaggeredBars from "./StaggeredBars";
import DisappearingComponent from "./DisappearingComponent";
import TranslateStaggeredBars from "./TranslateStaggeredBars";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* <Translate /> */}
      {/* <BarGraph /> */}
      {/* <StaggeredBars /> */}
      {/* <DisappearingComponent /> */}
      <TranslateStaggeredBars />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Create a new file called `TranslateStaggeredBars.js` and insert the following code:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  useTrail,
  animated,
  useSpring,
  useChain,
  config,
  useSpringRef,
} from "@react-spring/web";

const colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "orange", "purple", "yellow"];

const TranslateStaggeredBars = () => {
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);

  const springRef = useSpringRef();
  const spring = useSpring({
    from: { transform: `translateX(80px)` },
    to: { transform: `translateX(0px)` },
    ref: springRef,
    config: config.stiff,
    reverse: expanded,
  });

  const trailRef = useSpringRef();
  const trailSprings = useTrail(colors.length, {
    from: { height: "5px" },
    to: { height: "80px" },
    ref: trailRef,
    reverse: !expanded,
  });

  useChain([springRef, trailRef]);

  return (
    <div style={{ height: "500px" }}>
      <animated.div
        style={{
          ...spring,
          height: "100px",
          display: "inline-flex",
          alignItems: "flex-end",
          marginBottom: "15px",
        }}
      >
        {trailSprings.map((trailSpring, index) => (
          <animated.div
            key={colors[index]}
            style={{
              ...trailSpring,
              width: "20px",
              marginRight: "10px",
              transformOrigin: "bottom",
              backgroundColor: colors[index],
            }}
          />
        ))}
      </animated.div>
      <div>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={() => {
            setExpanded((prevState) => !prevState);
          }}
        >
          Click to Animate
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TranslateStaggeredBars;
```

We are using the same `colors` array from our example in `useTrail` section. We also introduced `ref` and the `reverse` keys

```javascript
const springRef = useSpringRef();
const spring = useSpring({
  from: { transform: `translateX(80px)` },
  to: { transform: `translateX(0px)` },
  ref: springRef,
  config: config.stiff, // this is a preset from react-spring
  reverse: expanded,
});

const trailRef = useSpringRef();
const trailSprings = useTrail(colors.length, {
  from: { height: "5px" },
  to: { height: "80px" },
  ref: trailRef,
  reverse: !expanded,
});

useChain(expanded ? [springRef, trailRef] : [trailRef, springRef]);
```

`useChain` takes an array of `ref`s to determine the order of execution. The `ref`s that are created (`springRef` and `trailRef`) are included in the animation configuration.

The `reverse` key allows us to swap the `from` and `to` properties of the animation.

## Summary

All the hook api's are very similar and they build off from the simplest `useSpring` api.

The examples here are simple enough to get you started on animating your React components. There are more advanced techniques (such as chaining using async/await methods and using interpolation) that I will write about in another post sometime later but for now, i'll refer you to the [react-spring documentation](https://react-spring.dev). Hope you have learned something from this post!
