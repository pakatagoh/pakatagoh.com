Hello! I'm PakataâœŒI was born in 1990 and raised in Singapore. If you're wondering why my name sounds strange, it's because it's a Buddhist name. I'm Singaporean Chinese. I attended the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://nus.edu.sg/) and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 2015. During university, I was part of the [NUS Formula Student team](https://www.facebook.com/nusformulasae/) competing in the [Formula Student (FSAE) Michigan](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/formula-sae-michigan/about) competiton.

In July 2018, I decided to leave my job as a technical sales engineer in the heavy industry to pursue software development as a career. As I was learning, I completed the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge and managed to secure an internship as a junior developer. In Feb 2019, I joined a bootcamp conducted by [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) (Singapore).

I've learnt a lot, both during my time of self-learning and during the bootcamp. I decided to create this website to further document my journey as a developer and to also share the knowledge I have gained thus far.

In my free time, I dabble in a little photography. I love cars and I keep up with Formula 1 during race weekends.
