Hello! I'm PakataâœŒI was born in 1990 and raised in the city of Singapore. My name is a Buddhist name if you're wondering. I attended the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://nus.edu.sg/) and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 2015. During university, I was part of the Formula Student team competing in the [Formula Student (FSAE) Michigan](https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/formula-sae-michigan/about) competiton. In July 2018, I decided to leave my job as a technical sales engineer in the heavy industry to pursue software development as a career.

Yes, I'm a self-taught developer. I created this website to further document my journey as a developer and to also share the knowledge I have gained thus far

In my free time, I dabble in a little photography. I love cars and I keep up with Formula 1 during race weekends.
