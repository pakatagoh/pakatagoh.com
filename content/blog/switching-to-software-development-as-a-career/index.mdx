Making a career switch is no easy decision and there are many factors at play. When I made the decision to switch, it was a result of common reasons you'll find online, tons of research and to a certain extent, luck.

In this post, I try my best to distill my personal reasons for the switch and how I prepared for it.

## Chancing upon web development

I was working for large engineering MNC and placed in the heavy industry department. I was dealing with technical sales of large hydraulic components and at a later stage during my work, I was dealing with factory automation and Industrial 4.0/ i4.0 (fancy way of saying connected and smart factories using IoT devices).

When I joined the company, I thought I would like the work I would be doing. It was my first job out of university and I was very naive. Don't get me wrong, the company is a good one, but after a year or so in the department/industry, I started to lose the drive and motivation.

However, thanks to a couple of colleagues of mine (you know who you are), I stumbled upon web development. This was about 6 months before I left the company. I was working on projects that involved gathering data from IoT devices and routing them into web-based dashboards. From time to time, some customizations were required and I had to dive into the code base. I had to research and learn JavaScript and before I knew it, I was hooked. For the first time in a long while, I was able to create something from scratch to solve a particular problem. It was a great feeling.

Many nights of research went by and my YouTube watch histroy went something like the following:

What is JavaScript? -> for loops in JavaScript -> What are APIs? -> What is web development ? -> How to become a web developer in 2017? -> How to become a Digital Nomad? etc

After a couple of months intense research, I decided that I wanted to become a web/software developer. Who knew that would be the case when my colleagues got me to work on IoT projects. At the same time, I had no passion for the industry I was in and I didn't have much motivation to sell the products (my department sells IoT hardware that already comes with preconfigured software).

It was my situation at work and definitely some luck that had a part to play in helping me realize I wanted to make a career switch.

## Push factors

Other than my circumstances/luck, there were definitely other push factors that made my decision to leave the company a lot easier.

As mentioned above, I had **no passion** in the heavy industry. Some people might like it, but I wasn't interested in the hardware that we were selling to cement plants, shipyards or factories. I didn't really care at all.

Travelling to the office took 1.5hrs and another 1.5hrs to get home. That's a **total of 3hrs!** To put that into perspective, after a month of going to work, I would lose a weekend (48hrs) of my life travelling. I definitely wasn't paid enough to lose a weekend like that.

Fear of regret was also a push factor. I knew I wanted to become a developer but I was also afraid of failing. Thanks to the YouTube gods of recommendation, I chanced upon one of [Gary V's video on regret](https://youtu.be/6221OqtXD04). I didn't want to regret 5-10 years down the road for not trying. If I failed, at least I knew I tried my best.

I also realized that for my personal situation, quiting and **switching ASAP was the right move for me**. I wasn't married, my parents were still in relatively good health, I was only 2 years into my professional career and I had the strongest drive to learn about code. I just couldn't stop coding during the nights after work. If I didn't switch ASAP, who knows what life might throw at me to make my decision to quit even harder.

## Getting prepared

I did lots of research in the evenings after work. I was on YouTube, Medium, freeCodeCamp and reddit looking at what was needed to become a developer. It was tough narrowing down requirements and deciding on what kind of developer I wanted to be.

I knew being an iOS developer was out of the question because I'm on a Windows machine. I didn't do much research into android development as well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. In the end I narrowed it down to web development with JavaScript as my language of focus as I already researched on it during work. There were also tons of resources for learning fullstack development with JavaScript.

I also discovered that **looking at job descriptions (JDs) helped me to narrow down the things I needed to learn** even before I knew I was ready to apply for a developer role. If you've

## Conclusion

the conclusion is that there is no conclusion
