Becoming a software developer is one of the few roles you can land without a software related degree. It was in early 2018 when I was exposed to web development at my previous job. It was not long until I decided that I wanted to become a developer. You can read more about how I prepared for this journey in [this post.](https://pakatagoh.com/blog/switching-to-software-development-as-a-career)

After lots of self-learning, an internship, a bootcamp and many interviews later, I'm finally working as a front-end web developer.

Below I go through how I got to where I am today.

## Self Learning (4 months)

## Internship (3 months)

## Bootcamp (3 months)

## Job Hunting (1.5 months)

## Resources to get started

- freeCodeCamp to get started with web development and JavaScript - https://www.freecodecamp.org
- Udemy for relatively affordable courses - https://www.udemy.com
- YouTube for almost anything - https://www.youtube.com

## Conclusion

- Find your motivation. If you don't have one, there really won't be anything to keep you going for months.
- Discipline and sacrifice. Learning something new is going to take lots of time. You only have 24 hours a day, so you'll have to sacrifice something to make time for learning.
- Read up on breadth then decide on where to go deep. There are many different fields in software, find the one you're most interested in and commit to it.
- Start somewhere, anywhere. Pick a tutorial on YouTube and follow along. Don't be afraid to stumble. What's the worst that can happen anyway?
