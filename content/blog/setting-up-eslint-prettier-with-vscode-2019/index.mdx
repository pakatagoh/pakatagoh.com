Setting up ESLint and prettier can be confusing at first, especially with VS Code. It was for me when I first started out. I was confused by the ESLint and prettier plugins in vscode and how they integrated with the linters, but things have been much more simplified in 2019. I was also confused by `eslint-plugin-prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier`..what is the difference? And when you setup the ESLint config file, what is being used where?

Hopefully this short tutorial will help clear up some confusion and point you in the right direction if you're just starting out.

## Getting started

Here's a short brief on what linting and ESLint are about if you're new to it.

> "Code linting is a type of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn’t adhere to certain style guidelines..."
>
> "Linting tools like ESLint allow developers to discover problems with their JavaScript code without executing it."

To start, create a new repository and run `npm init -y` to initialize a `package.json` file

## Eslint

Install `eslint` with the following command

`npm install --save-dev eslint`

Create a `.eslintrc.js` file in the root of your repository.

This is the file that holds all the settings/rules that will run against your javaScript code and it is usually placed in the root of your repository. If you want to place it somewhere other than the root, make sure to use the `-c` flag and specify the path of your ESLint config file when executing ESLint.

Example: `eslint -c /some/path/myEslintConfig.json myfiletotest.js`

You can read more about [ESLint Configuration Cascading an Hierarchy](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-cascading-and-hierarchy) if you want to use different ESLint files for different subdirectories in your project.

An example of an ESLint config is as below.

```javascript
// Sample .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  parser: "esprima", //default parser
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 10,
    ecmaFeatures: {
      jsx: true,
    },
  },
  env: {
    browser: true,
    jest: true,
  },
  plugins: ["react", "prettier"],
  extends: ["prettier", "react-app"],
  rules: {
    "no-unreachable": "error",
    "no-console": "error",
  },
}
```

The most common configuration keys you'll use are:

- `parser`
- `parserOptions`
- `env`
- `plugins`
- `extends`
- `rules`

You can [read more about configuring ESLint and the various options in the docs](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)

In this simple tutorial, we will only be configuring `plugins`, `extends` and `rules`

## Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. Meaning it takes care of code's spacings, line breaks, max line lengths etc.

Install `prettier` with the following command

`npm install --save-dev prettier`

Create a `.prettierrc.js` file in the root of your directory. This is where we will include all our desired prettier rules.

```javascript
//.prettierrc.js
module.exports = {
  printWidth: 120,
  trailingComma: "es5",
  tabWidth: 2,
  semi: false,
  singleQuote: true,
}
```

See more configuration options at [Prettier's site](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html)

### Prettier config

Some of the recommended rules by ESLint are code formatting rules that clash with prettier. For example, max length of lines or usage of double/single quotes. Since we are using prettier for our formatting, we want it to have priority in determining the format.

The `eslint-config-prettier` is a config by prettier that contains a set of rules which turns off/overrides the clashing ESLint rules.

To install, run `npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier`

To add this, insert `prettier` into the `extends` array. Add this at the end of the `extends` array in order for it to override all other configs.

```javascript
//.eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    "prettier", //highlight-line
  ],
}
```

We can use `prettier` in the `extends` field because ESLint recognizes the `eslint-config-` prefix automatically.

### Prettier plugin

`eslint-plugin-prettier` is a plugin that allows ESLint to run prettier as a rule.

To install, run `npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-prettier`

Add this plugin to your `.eslintrc.js` in the `plugins` array.

Add the prettier rule in the `rules` object

```javascript
//.eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["prettier"], //highlight-line
  extends: ["prettier"],
  rules: {
    //highlight-line
    "prettier/prettier": "error", //highlight-line
  }, //highlight-line
}
```

Just like the `eslint-config-` prefix, the reason why we use `prettier` here and not `eslint-plugin-prettier` is because ESLint recognizes the `eslint-plugin-` prefix automatically.

If a prettier rule is broken, there will be an ESLint error under the name `prettier/prettier` because we are running prettier as a rule in ESLint.

## Running ESLint

Create a file called `ugly.js` in the root with the following content

```javascript
//ugly.js

//Note all the inconsistent spacings, the semicolon and the use of console.log
function someUglyFunction(x, y, z) {
  if (z) {
    const a = x + y
    return a
  }
  console.log("this is bad")

  return x - y
}
```

In your `package.json`, include the following script

```json
{
  "script": {
    "eslint": "eslint ." // this will run eslint on all files
  }
}
```

In your terminal, navigate into your repository and run `npm run eslint`

You should get an output in the terminal that looks something like the following:

```
  1:26  error  Replace `·(x,y,·z·` with `(x,·y,·z`  prettier/prettier
  2:5   error  Replace `(·` with `·(` prettier/prettier
  3:16  error  Replace `+y;·` with `·+·y` prettier/prettier
  6:3   error  Unexpected console statement no-console
  8:13  error  Insert `·` prettier/prettier
  9:2   error  Insert `⏎` prettier/prettier

✖ 6 problems (6 errors, 0 warnings)
  5 errors and 0 warnings potentially fixable with the `--fix` option.
```

If you see this, congrats! You've successfully configured ESLint and Prettier!

In this log, we see that we have lots of prettier errors `prettier/prettier` and one ESLint error `no-console`. We will get to fixing all these errors in the following sections and explain the `--fix` option by ESLint

## VS Code Settings

In VS Code, we can integrate fixing linting errors like the ones in the previous section as part of our workflow when we save files.

To integrate ESLint and Prettier into your VS Code workflow, you should install the [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) VS Code extension

> Note: In the past, the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension should also be installed to integrate with the ESLint extension. But now, it is recommended to run prettier via an ESLint configuration, which we have already done above. If you already have the Prettier extension installed, it shouldn't cause conflicts with the configuration we have done so far. If you do have conflicts, try to update your Prettier extension

After installing the ESLint extension, you'll start to see red wavy underlines which indicate errors

<Image
  src="/images/setting-up-eslint-prettier-with-vscode-2019/eslint-prettier-error.png"
  width={1670}
  height={945}
  alt="ESLint error"
/>

(`Insert '.'` means insert a space)
w
Go to your VS Code JSON settings by using the command palette.
Press `CTRL + SHIFT + P` on windows or `⇧+⌘+P` on mac to open the command palette. Next, type in `Open Settings(JSON)` and enter. Your `settings.json` file should open.

Insert the following:

```json
{
  "eslint.autoFixOnSave": true,
  "eslint.run": "onSave"
}
```

When you save your file, the ESLint extension will run with the config we have set in the above section and also try to fix any errors that occur. Essentially, whenever you save your file the `eslint --fix fileBeingSaved.js` command will run.

Now try saving `ugly.js` again and see how the spacings in the file are fixed. It should look something like below:

<Image
  src="/images/setting-up-eslint-prettier-with-vscode-2019/eslint-fix.png"
  width={1453}
  height={658}
  alt="Eslint fix"
/>

All the red wavy errors are gone except for the one at `console.log`. This is because ESLint was not able to fix that error. To fix that error, we have to manually remove that `console.log` from our file.

If you wish to run the fix via the command line, you can. In your `package.json` add the following in `script`:

```json
{
  "script": {
    "eslint:fix": "eslint --fix ." // lint all files and attempt to fix all errors if any
  }
}
```

In your terminal, run `npm run eslint:fix`. All files will be formatted and ESLint will try to fix all errors.

## Bonus - Integrating husky and lint-staged

Husky is a tool that helps to create git hooks easily while lint-staged allows us to run scripts on files that have been staged in git.

In this bonus section, we will use husky to create a `pre-commit` git hook that runs lint-staged which in turns runs ESLint to lint our staged files before they are committed.

Install husky and lint-staged with the following command.

`npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged`

In your `package.json`, add the following lines:

```json
{
  "script": {
    "staging-eslint:fix": "eslint --fix" // this does not have the '.' at the end of the command
  },
  "lint-staged": { "*.{js, jsx}": ["npm run staging-eslint:fix", "git add"] },
  "husky": {
    "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
  }
}
```

The `husky` setting will create a `pre-commit` hook that runs `lint-staged`

The `lint-staged` setting will run the `staging-eslint:fix` script on any staged `*.js` or `*.jsx` file. Once all the files have been fixed, the fixes will be added to staging via `git add`. Next, all staged files will be committed.

Now try making some bad changes to a `.js` file (eg. add some inconsistent spaces), save it without formatting, stage it and commit. In the terminal, you will see lint-stage being executed and the file with bad changes will be fixed.

> Tip: To save without formatting, open the command palette and search for `Save without Formatting` and press enter. This will save the file but no formatting will be made.

## Conclusion

ESLint is an integral part of any JavaScript developer's toolkit. It helps to detect patterns that are not part of a certain guideline and helps to prevent any potential bugs that may occur before run time. With Prettier, your code base will be more organized and everyone will follow a certain style of formatting. Your git diffs will be less about spacings or single/double quotes and more about the logic.

If you're not using ESLint/Prettier already, I highly recommend it to help with the housekeeping of your code. Life will be better 😂
