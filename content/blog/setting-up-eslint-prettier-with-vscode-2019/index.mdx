Setting up eslint and prettier can be confusing at first, especially with VS Code. It was for me when I first started out. I was confused by the eslint and prettier plugins in vscode and how they integrated with the linters, but things have been much more simplified in 2019. I was also confused by `eslint-plugin-prettier` and `eslint-config-prettier`..what is the difference? And when you setup the eslint config file, what is being used where?

Hopefully this short tutorial will help clear up some confusion and point you in the right direction if you're just starting out.

## Getting started

You can clone the following repository:

- https://github.com/pakatagoh/setup-eslint-prettier

or you can just use your own.

## Eslint

Install `eslint` with the following command

`npm install --save-dev eslint`

Create a `.eslintrc.js` file in the root of your repository.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //empty
};
```

## Prettier

Install `prettier` with the following command

`npm install --save-dev prettier`

Create a `.prettierrc.js` file in the root of your directory. This is where we will include all our desired prettier rules.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  printWidth: 120,
  trailingComma: 'es5',
  tabWidth: 2,
  semi: false,
  singleQuote: true,
};
```

See more configuration options at [prettier's site](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html)

### Prettier plugin

`eslint-plugin-prettier` is a plugin that allows eslint to run prettier as a rule.

Add this plugin to your `.eslintrc.js` in the `plugins` array.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['prettier'], //highlight-line
  rules: {
    'prettier/prettier': 'error',
  },
};
```

The reason why we use `prettier` here and not `eslint-plugin-prettier` is because eslint recognizes the `eslint-plugin-` prefix automatically.

If a prettier rule is broken, there will be an eslint error under the name `prettier/prettier` because we are running prettier as a rule in eslint.

In VS Code, you'll see it in this form:

### Prettier config

Some of the recommended rules by eslint are code formatting rules that clash with prettier. For example, max length of lines or usage of double/single quotes. Since we are using prettier for our formatting, we want it to have priority in determining the format.

The `eslint-config-prettier` is a config by prettier that turns off/overrides the clashing eslint rules.

To add this, insert `prettier` into the `extends` array. Add this at the end of the `extends` array in order for it to override all other configs.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['prettier'],
  extends: [
    'some-other-config-you-use',
    'prettier', //highlight-line
  ],
  rules: {
    'prettier/prettier': 'error',
  },
};
```

Just like the `plugin` field, we can use `prettier` in the `extends` field because eslint recognizes the `eslint-config-` prefix automatically.

## VS Code Settings

To integrate eslint and prettier into your VS Code workflow, you should install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) VS Code extensions

Configure the settings as follows:

```json
{
  "something": "something"
}
```

## Eslint with Create React App

Create React App(CRA) now allows you to extend the eslint config built into it. (At the moment of writing this post, I'm referring to CRA 3.2.0. I believe this feature was first introduced in 3.1 but has been slowly iterated over since. But chose a version that works for you and refer to the docs for it)

## Bonus - Integrating husky and lint-staged

Husky is a tool that helps to create git hooks easily while lint-staged allows us to run scripts on files that have been staged in git.

In this bonus section, we will use husky to create a `pre-commit` git hook that runs lint-staged which in turns runs eslint to lint our staged files before they are committed.

Install husky and lint-staged with the following command.

`npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged`

In your `package.json`, add the following lines:

```json
{
  "lint-staged": { ".{js, jsx}": ["npm run lint:fix", "git add"] },
  "husky": {
    "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
  }
}
```
